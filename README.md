# rsync-incremental-backups

**Background**

I had been using `rsnapshot` for years, but it recently stopped working, for unknown reasons.  I therefore crafted my own, easier-to-follow (understand) alternative.

See the comments im `hourly.sh` to understand the code and configuration (paths; crontab; ...).  I included a copy of my `rsync` "excludes" file, also for your reference (efit per your backup specifications).
